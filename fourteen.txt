  A try-except block can have multiple except statements. There is no strict limit on the number of except blocks you can have; you can use as many as needed to handle different exceptions. Each except block can handle a different type of exception.

Built-in Exception Classes:
  
  ArithmeticError
  ZeroDivisionError
  OverflowError
  FloatingPointError
  AttributeError
  ImportError
  ModuleNotFoundError
  ValueError
  KeyError
  IndentationError
