The finally block in Python is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This makes it an ideal place for cleanup actions that must be performed under all circumstances, such as closing files, releasing resources, or resetting states.

example:

try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File has been closed.")
